# Complexities 

### Keeping track of things we may want to consider for the future:

- (Pass interference buffer:= * |=> buffer := 0)
- Curved OLine
- WR runs from line of scrimmage.. We can only throw in a range say 70-80 yards, to ensure we get as far as possible, but also, ensure that we can actually send the ball
