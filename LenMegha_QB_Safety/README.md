by Len Huang and Megha Jain (lghuang, meghaj2)

Here are our final deliverables. If you would like to explore
some other rough sketches, feel free to check out the following

### Directory

- `1_JustQB_Proof.kyx` - A proof of a model just containing the
  Quarterback, Defensive Line, and Offensive Line
- `2_Zone_Proof.kyx` - A proof of a model that added the Wide Receiver
  and Linebacker in a Zone defense scenario
- `3_Future.kyx` - An unproved model that has many of the ideas
  we would like to implement including an advanced QB controller,
  Dynamic Game Logic, and a consideration of the Man defense scenario.
