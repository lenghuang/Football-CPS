- `EntireDuration.png`: Pondering the nuances about how we define `maxPass`. If `maxPass` is what the humanely longest distance is, then we have to account for cases where we are not able to pass in the duration of our play. We can be more conservative / safer by defining a smaller `maxPass`, that instead serves as a heuristic for movement, chosen in such a way that we move forward and backwards still, but always stay within the humanely possible distance and are never not able to pass. However, the question becomes what gives us the right to choose this heuristic, and is this something our CPS would be able to replicate correctly (or the human know when to move back and forth)?
