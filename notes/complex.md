# Complexities 

### Keeping track of things we may want to consider for the future:

- (Pass interference buffer:= * |=> buffer := 0)
- Curved OLine
- WR runs from line of scrimmage.. We can only throw in a range say 70-80 yards, to ensure we get as far as possible, but also, ensure that we can actually send the ball
- Generalize the starting position (issues --> if we are too close to 0, QB might run off the field, if we are too close to 300, there is less space to run forward)
- Instead of WR Open <=> pass, can calculate distance / time needed for a ball to travel for some velocity within the loop guard

### Common Bugs:
- Lower bound by lower case `diff`
- Not expanding definitions 
- Forgetting that you hard coded `maxVel = vyD`
