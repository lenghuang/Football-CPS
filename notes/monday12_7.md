Ask Jonathan:

- First, our model issue with <a>P and [a]!P

Work with Z3 --> to fix this issue and do proof by hand

- Second as we move to model QB movement forward and backward, 
we want to ensure the subtlety that we cannot have our QB intersect 
with the Dl and then travel backwards to safety (such that the QB 
was tackled and then safe again) For that reason we have the Domain 
Constraint is yQB < yDL, we want to end the play right there and lose. 
Of course an issue is that you do not want to have the post condition 
as a domain constraint, but such is the case for a BOX modality.. diamond different?

Remove from safety condition


- defining max Pass look @ github

discuss both in our presentation..

instantiate quantifiers
interesting proof plus model:
