“One thing to note which was weird, was that our proof was false depending on the order in which we applied rules. For example “expandAllDefs ; unfold ; assignd(1) ; composed(1) ; solve(1.1) ; solve(1) ; auto” (the tactic in trial2_Proof.kyx) proves. However If you were to do something like “expandAllDefs ; unfold ; assignd(1) ; composed(1) ; solve(1) ; solve(1.1) ; auto” it ends up being false. Note that I’m not sure I did the tactic syntax correctly, but the idea is that it proves false if you solve the outside ODE before you solve the inside one. In our tactic, we solve the inside ODE before we solve the outside ODE. Perhaps this may help provide greater context about our proof” - Len
