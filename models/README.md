- `trial0.kyx`: Discount follow the leader
- `trial1.kyx`: Line collision / dampening model
- `trial2.kyx`: Introducing WR / LB
  - `trail2_bad.kyx`: Proof of a man defense due to something unsound in Mathematica
  - `trial2_loop.kyx`: Attempts at modelling QB controller without backward movement
- `trial3.kyx`: Introducing QB controller for forward / backward movement

Any file of the form `trialN_proof.kyx` is the respective proof for the `Nth` iteration of our model.
